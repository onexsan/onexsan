### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

A solution-driven **Frontend developer**Â withÂ **2.5+ years**Â of experience. I aspire to develop fast, scalable and great-looking web applications.

I have extensive experience with **Vue (2/3)**, **Nuxt.js** and **TypeScript**. Over the years I helped companies improve thier **website performance optimization**, implemented **SSR**, worked with **responsive and adaptive web design**, gave advice on **UI/UX** patterns, learned **SEO** and **accessibility** best practices and used a variety of most popular libraries (**i18n, form validation, user authentification** - the list could go on and on!). 

Iâ€™m not afraid of diving into new technologies and always trying to stay up-to-date on trends in the industry. Iâ€™d love to work with a team of motivated professionals willing to develop high-quality products.

- âš¡ _Fun fact:_ I love writing stories and creating small indie-games! Once I've written a visual novel from scratch on Ren'py - even though I've never touched Python before
