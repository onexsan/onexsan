### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a **Frontend (Vue.js) developer** with **>1.5 years** of experience. I'm also familiar with **Vuex+Vue-router** and **Nuxt.js** and use it in my everyday work. I believe that web should look great, feel good and be fun!

You can read more about my _skills_ in my [portfolio](https://onexsan.github.io/filileeva-ls/). And if you want to have a look at my recent _projects_ - check out the pinned section below!

- ðŸŒ± _Iâ€™m currently learning_ **Typescript** and **Vue 3**! Also I've just started looking into **algorithms** more thoroughly.
